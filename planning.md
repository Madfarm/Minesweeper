# **Minesweeper**


## Day 1
Let's build and style the html layout then construct the board class and if we have time the factory method for instantiating the square/cell class
>HTML layout/submit button implementation and JS testing
>Styling the layout
>Board class
>Factory method for cell/square instance

## Day 2
I accomplished much more than I intended on day one, so today I will be focussing on some of the more advanced aspects of the game, but some research is also required
> research right click eventlistener and how to skip an iteration in a loop

> placeMines method
>
> - surprise! time to research recursion

> gameOver method

> flagging a square

> Probably Day 3
>
> - checkMines method
> - adding recursive flood feature to checkmines method

## Day 3
The fabled Day 3. Here comes the biggest mountain of this program. I've freed the entire day up to implement this one feature and I have a good feeling I might need it.
> checkMines()  
> - likely needs recursion
> - likely also requires a method for testing
>> "The Flood" feature
>> - similarily likely needs recursion

## Day 4
Now that we are MVP we can focus on QoL features and cosmetics
> adding an img/asset for the mines and flags
> reset button functionality
> - try to move the reset button
> add first click immunity
> update the readme file
> add a color index for each amount of mines
> add palette swapping(stretch goal)
