# **Minesweeper**


## Day 1
Let's build and style the html layout then construct the board class and if we have time the factory method for instantiating the square/cell class

>Styling the layout
>Board class
>Factory method for cell/square instance

## Day 2
I accomplished much more than I intended on day one, so today I will be focussing on some of the more advanced aspects of the game, but some research is also required
> research right click eventlistener and how to skip an iteration in a loop

> placeMines method
>
>> surprise! time to research recursion

> gameOver method

> flagging a square

> Probably Day 3
>
>> checkMines method
>> adding recursive flood feature to checkmines method
