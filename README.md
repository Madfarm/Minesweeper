# **Minesweeper**

## Description
Minesweeper is an iconic logic puzzle computer game created in the 90s by Microsoft which took inspiration from the game *Mined-Out* which launched in 1983. It is a game that features a matrix of clickable tiles with hidden mines placed throughout the board. The goal is to clear the entire board without clicking a single mine. To assist you in this endeavor is a feature that allows you to mark where you think mines are via right-clicking the tile.
